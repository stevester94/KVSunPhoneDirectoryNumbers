The data that you put into the excel sheet is exactly how it will go into the app!
Keep in mind, computers are very dumb, which means you have to be very precise!
For example, "800-555-5555" is different than "800 555 5555", these kinds of things trip the computer up.

Ignore the file "current", you won't have to mess with that.

Explanation of the workbook #
#############################
There are two sheets: Entries, Categories

the "Entries" sheet is the data that I've pulled from the text of the phonebook.

the "displayName" column is what the user will see on a row of the app 
- in the phonebook it is usually the heading of an entry, IE a person or business.
- displayName is the unique identifier for an entry in the phone book.
- displayName can't contain line breaks
- displayName can't contain phone numbers
  - This helps keep the data organized!

the "allLines" column is the entire text of an entry from the phonebook, this is important for multiline entries.
- this is where the actual info for an entry is kept (IE phone numbers, and any other misc. info)

the "bannerPath" column is where you specify the image name for the ad for that entry
- can't contain the file extension
- if there isn't a banner then just put "no path entered"


the "Categories" sheet lets the app know which category in the yellow pages an Entry belongs to.

the "displayName" column will contain the same displayName's from the "Entries" sheet
- This MUST be EXACTLY the same between the two sheets, it will be best to do a copy and paste for the display names
  - If they aren't the exact same all sorts of bad things will happen to the app!

the "category" column says which categories that entry should belong to
- An entry can belong to any number of categories, just make new rows and new category names as necessary.
- Again, category names need to be exactly the same, otherwise they'll show up as distinct categories.

#############################
Explanation of Banners      #
#############################
The banners for the ads are under the folder "banners"
Sizes are as follows:
-Standard: 600x254
-Half Screen: 600x500
-Full Screen: 600x1000

These are rough approximations, actual screen coverage depends on the resolution of the phone, but these will be good enough.

All banner files should be saved as .jpg

Important info              #
#############################

Adding people or businesses to the spreadsheet is as easy as making a new row, just fill out the columns accordingly
- Line breaks in excel are done with "Alt + Enter"
Adding new images is as easy as putting it in the banner folder and setting the banner column for that business accordingly

It's important to note that if a business is to have a different banner for different categories in the yellow pages then
it actually needs to have a completely seperate entry in the "Entries" sheet. See Barnes Bargains for an example.

It's VERY important to be consistent! IE numbers should always be in the form ###-####
- It doesn't matter how you format something, it's just important to keep it consistent.

If you delete an entry out of the "Entries" sheet, be sure to do the same in the Categories sheet.
